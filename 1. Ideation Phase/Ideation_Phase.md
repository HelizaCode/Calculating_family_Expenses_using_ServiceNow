# Ideation Phase

## Introduction
The Ideation Phase involves identifying the core problem, understanding its context, and proposing a conceptual solution. In this project, the ideation focuses on automating the tracking and calculation of family expenses using ServiceNow.

## Problem Statement
Managing and tracking family expenses manually can lead to inconsistencies, data loss, and poor visibility into financial activities. Traditional methods such as spreadsheets or paper-based records make it difficult to categorize, analyze, and automate expenses. This project proposes an automated solution using ServiceNow that records, categorizes, and calculates family expenses efficiently.

## Abstract
In today’s digital era, managing family expenses requires a systematic and transparent process. This project, titled “Calculating Family Expenses Using ServiceNow,” focuses on leveraging ServiceNow’s platform to automate the process of tracking daily and family-based expenses. By using ServiceNow tables, forms, and relationships, the system enables users to enter daily expense details, associate them with specific family members, and automatically compute totals.

## Introduction (Detailed)
Families often struggle to maintain accurate expense records. Manual record-keeping through spreadsheets or notebooks is prone to duplication and inefficiency. ServiceNow provides a platform to automate such processes through custom tables, business rules, and relationships. This project develops a Family Expenses application that automates expense entry, categorization, and calculation for each family member.
